Here’s a snippet I’m proud of:

```css
main {
  width: 95%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Practice improving color contrast.

### Useful resources
